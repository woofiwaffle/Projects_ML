## Task 1. Dataset Exploration

#### The task consists of the following subtasks:

1. Provide a brief description of each dataset in your Jupyter Notebook:
* The subject area, data source, and the nature of the data (real or synthetic).
* What attributes are present in the dataset, their type (numerical, categorical), and what they represent.

2. For each attribute, perform the following analysis:
* Determine the mean and standard deviation.
* Plot a histogram of the distribution of values and identify if there are any outliers.
* Check if there are any missing values and how many.

3. Determine the correlation between parameters:
* Identify which attributes are highly correlated and determine the nature of their correlation.
* Identify which attributes do not have a correlation.

4. Visualize the relationships between variables:
* Create scatter plots (preferably a pairplot matrix).
* Analyze the obtained results.
